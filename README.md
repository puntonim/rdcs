**Residenze del Centro Storico Frontend**
=========================================

Residenze del Centro Storico frontend for the web app deployed at: https://puntonim.github.io/rdcs/

With HTML and vanilla JavaScript.


IMPORTANT
=========
This source code resides in the private repo: https://github.com/puntonim/residenze-del-centro-storico-monorepo.
Do not ever checkout and push code to https://github.com/puntonim/rdcs/ but instead use
 the private repo.

So why does this repo even exist?
Since GitHub Pages can only exist in free *public* repos then when deploying the 
 frontend, the FE code is force-pushed to this public repo.


Deployment
==========
```shell
$ make deploy
```
